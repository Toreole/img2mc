To update the textures for a build:
- extract missing textures from the minecraft [version].jar and put them inside the mc_textures folder
  - use 7-zip or another software that can open .jar files
  - textures are located in the /assets/minecraft/textures folder
- Build and run the TexMetadataGenerator project, for ease just do it VisualStudio directly.
  - supply the full path to the mc_textures folder (copy paste)
  - confirm path (y)
  - for deployments: enter 'n' when asked if the output should be human readable. if you want to look through the file yourself to validate, press 'y'
- move the __output_metadata.json file out of the mc_textures folder, and rename it to tex_metadata.json
